  System: I noticed some inconsistencies in the JSON you provided, particularly for games with IDs 23, 25, 26, 27, 29, and 30, where the `title`, `developer`, `description`, `genre`, and other fields don't align with the actual games (e.g., "Forza Horizon 5" is incorrectly described as an RPG). Below, I've corrected these entries to ensure all fields accurately reflect the respective games, while preserving the `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` from your input unless they were clearly incorrect. I've also maintained the JSON structure and ensured consistency with the rest of the data. For games like "Forza Horizon 5," which is not confirmed for PS5, I’ve treated it as a hypothetical PS5 edition as per your list.
  
  ### Changes Made
  - **ID 23 (Death Stranding 2: On the Beach)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "Kojima Productions" (was Capcom).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect Death Stranding 2, not Monster Hunter Wilds.
    - Adjusted `gameplayHours` and `metacriticScore` to speculative values since the game isn’t released yet.
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
  - **ID 25 (The Midnight Walk)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "MoonHood" (was Quantic Dream).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect The Midnight Walk, not Star Wars: Eclipse.
    - Adjusted `publisher` to "MoonHood" and `countryOfOrigin` to "Poland."
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
  - **ID 26 (Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "Warhorse Studios" (was Konami).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, not Metal Gear Solid Delta.
    - Adjusted `publisher` to "Deep Silver" and `countryOfOrigin` to "Czech Republic."
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
  - **ID 27 (Forza Horizon 5)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "Playground Games" (was Warhorse Studios).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect Forza Horizon 5, not Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.
    - Adjusted `publisher` to "Xbox Game Studios" and `countryOfOrigin` to "UK."
    - Changed `gameType` to "Multiplayer" and `internetRequired` to "Yes for online features."
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
    - Note: Forza Horizon 5 is not available on PS5, so this is treated as a hypothetical edition.
  - **ID 29 (Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "Konami" (was Insomniac Games).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect Metal Gear Solid Delta, not Marvel’s Wolverine.
    - Adjusted `publisher` to "Konami" and `countryOfOrigin` to "Japan."
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
  - **ID 30 (The Outer Worlds 2)**:
    - Corrected `developer` to "Obsidian Entertainment" (was Bloober Team).
    - Updated `description`, `genre`, `about`, and `trailerVideo` to reflect The Outer Worlds 2, not Silent Hill 2.
    - Adjusted `publisher` to "Private Division" and `countryOfOrigin` to "USA."
    - Kept `price`, `image`, `faqs`, and `similarProducts` as provided.
  - **General Notes**:
    - Ensured `platform` field is consistently an array (e.g., `["PS5"]`).
    - Kept `metacriticScore` and `releaseDate` as provided, even for unreleased games, assuming they are speculative.
    - Corrected minor inconsistencies in `similarProducts` where IDs referenced non-existent games (e.g., IDs 32, 43, 45) by replacing them with valid games from the list.
    - Verified that `faqs` and `similarProducts` are relevant to the corrected game titles.
  
  ### Corrected JSON
  Below is the corrected JSON with only the entries from ID 22 to ID 30, as the earlier entries (ID 1 to 21) were consistent and didn’t require changes. If you want the full JSON (ID 1 to 30), let me know, and I can provide it.
